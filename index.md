# Vasont Inspire SDK Documentation

## Introduction

The GlobalLink Inspire CCMS SDK is an open-source connector library, maintained by GlobalLink Vasont in GitHub, that provides a wrapper around the interactions necessary to communicate with an instance of the Inspire Web API.

The Inspire Web API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded request bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms), in almost all cases returns [JSON-encoded responses](https://www.json.org/), returns [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) in most cases, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

Developers who are working within the Inspire Preview environment (Sandbox, Demo, 3rd Party Developers) will work with Preview versions of the API and related SDK versions.

Live Inspire customers will work with [LTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support) versions of the API and related SDK versions.
